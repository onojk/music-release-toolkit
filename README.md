# music-release-toolkit
This toolkit helps musicians prepare their albums for smooth digital distribution. It ensures your .wav files are unique, applies consistent sequential naming (Number01.wav, Number02.wav, â€¦), and generates a ready-to-use playlist.m3u. Perfect for streamlining uploads to DistroKid, SUNO.com, and similar platforms.
